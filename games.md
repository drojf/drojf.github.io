## Favorite 'Free' games

Games are vaguely ordered in how much they are worth your time.

- [**Cave Story**](https://www.cavestory.org/) \- Highly Recommended
  - Platformer with similar game mechanics to Metroid (or so I hear). I really enjoyed this game. After you have finished it, read a guide for extras/easter eggs
  - There is a version on Switch/Steam with upgraded graphics, but many prefer the original free version. The steam version is [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave_Story/) (not free!)

- **Mother 3** - Highly Recommended
  - Give it a go, even if you don't usually play RPGs (I usually don't, but I still enjoyed this game immensely). Technically, this game is not free, but the only way for you to play it these days is free through an emulator (there was never any official English release!).

- [**Ib**](http://vgboy.dabomstew.com/other/ib.htm) \- Highly Recommended
  - a horror/puzzle game. Better described at the english translation website. I suggest using a walkthrough after you have finished it once to see what you missed/didn't miss or if you get stuck. Now that I think about it, it was quite beautiful.

- [**Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle**](https://aeresland.net/) Recommended
  - "Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle is a "sprite opera" made by Saint Bomber in RPG Maker 2003."
  - When you get stuck (believe me, you will), you can use this [Google Doc Walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3_9cWCMpCgdyiIiVNx4iIvOCfJMbKgfYOIz4zmSZVw/)
  - I initially rated this "Moderately Recommended", but looking back, I really do like it, and it's still very memorable after a long period of time.

- [**Tyrian**](https://bitbucket.org/opentyrian/opentyrian/wiki/Home)
  - Old shoot'em up, now free due the original licences being nice. Google OpenTyrian for downloads - no need to run on dosbox since it was ported to x86

- [**Osu!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/)
  - Rhythm game (basically Elite Beat Agents), very fun as no thinking is required. May injure your wrist if you play using a mouse. [my osu! page](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/drojf "My osu page. osu is a game like elite beat agents. or so i've heard.")
  - If you experience visual lag on Intel integrated graphics, disable Speedstep (ie make your CPU run at max clock speed constantly)!

- Only for people who enjoyed the atmosphere/story of VA-11 Hall-A: There was a limited time collab with Girls Front line and VA-11 Hall-A. Seeing as it's no longer available, I feel like it's allowable to link to a video playthrough of the entire collab. However you may need to play Girls Front Line a little to get the gist of things, before playing.

## Favorite Paid games

- [**Outer Wilds**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/) (NOT "The Outer Worlds"!) - Highly Recommended
  - If any of the following appeal to you, you'll probably enjoy this game:
    - Adventure/Exploration
    - Mystery
    - Science-Fiction
  - Best if you go in completely blind (don't even watch any trailers!)
  - The game can be scary in some unconventional (and conventional) ways, if that's a problem for you.
  - It is possible to get stuck in this game, to the point where the developers have changed the game/are continously updating the game based on feedback.
    - The game has a in-built system for taking notes of what you've learned, but perhaps manually taking notes of important things will help.
    - Sticking to one place at a time rather than going off everywhere may make you less confused
  - Gameplay Tips
    - In general, whenever there are prompts on the screen, try all of them out/activating all of them to learn what they do. Almost every action will be useful at some point.
    - Don't forget your ship has a log computer, and a health/fuel refill station. Have a good look inside your ship.
    - Don't forget about the "match velocity" button while using your ship/suit.
    - You can take a picture using the scouter without sending out a scout
    - You can meet someone who can teach you an important ability if you read their dialogue
    - Try out actions available at the bonfire
    - If you're finding an area annoying to repeatedly enter, there's probably a shortcut there.
  - Noclip did [a documentary on the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbY0mBXKKT0) (contains spoilers)

- [**Planescape: Torment (PC)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/Planescape_Torment_Enhanced_Edition/) - Highly Recommended. There is one point you can get stuck in this game...if you get stuck, look it up.
  - NOTE before buying: [Read the comments section of the GOG page](https://www.gog.com/game/planescape_torment_enhanced_edition). Probably still worth buying, especially when it is on sale.
  - One of my favorite pieces of media, however it's due to the overall presentation of the game story, world, etc, not because of the gameplay of the game.
  - ask someone about the game. there are many small things which do not spoil anything and do not detract from the game's experience but will help you play the game
  - If you are the type to just finish a game quickly and not read any of the text...don't play this game
  - Do all the quests you can find, talk to every major NPC. Save often. Sometimes you might not be able to go back.
  - Supposedly there is a 'upgraded' version on GOG, but I hear it has some bugs. Look into this before buying it.
  - There is a sequel called 'Torment: Tides of Numenera'. While still good, I don't think it is as good as the first game.

- **Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective (NDS, iOS)**  - Recommended
  - fun game with a nice story (by the same director as phoenix wright)

- **Umineko Series (PC, PS3)** - [Steam Question Arcs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/) - [Steam PS3 patch page](https://github.com/07th-mod/guide/wiki/Umineko-Getting-started) - Recommended
  - Very long, definitely only consider this if you are willing to commit to it
  - Personally I feel like I enjoyed the first (1-4) more than the second(5-8), although both are still great
  - There are mods which add voice acting, upgraded sprites and backgrounds ported from the PS3 game
    - The 07th mod patched version patches the MG release to add in as much as is feasible with the MG engine
    - The Umineko Project version is (kind of) a script interpreter for the PS3 game, so it's much closer to PS3 game. This mod is harder to obtain, and the Answer arcs aren't fully complete yet (as of 2018)
    - You might find some older 'umitweak' releases floating around - these patched the original game which only ran at 640x480 resolution.

- [**Antichamber**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/) - Recommended
  - First person mind bending puzzle game. Often on sale on steam.

- [**Yakuza 0**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/) - Recommended
  - Well worth the $20 USD price, a good bit of fun and entertaining/dramatic story. However, I didn't the older games nearly as much as this prequel.
  - Often on sale which makes it even more worth it.

- **Phoenix Wright Series (GBA/NDS)**
  - really liked the first game - Recommended

- [Disgaea 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/405900/Disgaea_PC/) - PC and Various Consoles
  - I really enjoyed this game, but it's been so long since I played it I find it hard to give a good review
  - I remember enjoying the story, dialogue, as well as the strategy elements and music
  - While this is a "tactical RPG", it feels "fun and silly" due to the over the top game mechanics like being able to physically pick up units - by repeating this you can form a stack of units. Other elements/levels make it seem more like a puzzle game.

- [Prey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/) - PC and Various Console
  - This game is meant to be a spiritual successor to system shock (which I haven't played), but to fans of Dishonored and Deus Ex it may seem familiar
  - There are various things that people have praised in this game, but what I like most is freedom - the interconnectivity of the map, large number of ways to tackle enemies and objectives, different skill options. This also makes exploration feel more natural.
  - While this is tagged as Horror, this mainly comes from jump scares, and also depends how you play. I believe this is due to the enemy designs, but also that you can get away with running around instead of sneaking slowly (on normal difficulty at least).
  - Greatly enjoyed the overall feeling of exploring the space station becoming increasingly invaded by alien lifeforms.
  - **Technical Recommendation**: Play this on a SSD. Even on an SSD, the load times are fairly long, so on a HDD it would probably be unbearable.
  - I hope you like listening to audio logs.

- [Paradise Killer](http://paradisekiller.com/) - PC([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1160220/Paradise_Killer/), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/paradise_killer)) and [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/paradise-killer-switch/)
  - Indie Adventure/Detective game with amazing atosphere, setting, style, music, freely explorable 3D world. For me the world setting (and just figuring out the setting) is what I found most interesting/addictive, with everything else a big plus ontop of that.
  - While I think some things could have been done to improve the experience (emotionality of the game/character development, 3D lighting, having full voice acting rather than just voice emotes), these are just wishlist things rather than dealbreakers.
  - Revise evidence periodically - don't leave it to be banked up for a long time, as it will be harder to remember everything, and takes away from the fun of postulating about what happened.
  - Don't worry about running out of crystals - I finished the game with 60+ excess crystals I never used. Always buy any drinks/upgrades you can find, then if you have spare crystals buy one fast travel in each area.
  - I had lots of trouble getting to the prisoner bridge control panel...because I missed something obvious. Just walk around the perimeter of the metal cage while looking at it carefully and you should find it - the entrance is literally just next to it.
  - Footbaths contain *different* upgrades. I played the entire game with only one footbath upgrade, as I thought all footbaths provided the same upgrade...
  - Take a good look around you rather than running everywhere, you may spot interesting things (may be worth noting down for later).
  - Important Game Options:
    - If you get motion sickness, try disabling motion blur, and customizing the FOV setting (make it wider)
    - If you find the "voice emotes" annoying, you can disable them in the menu (but I got used to it and left it on)
    - There is a "Mature Content" option - this only uncensors swear words and enables some voice emotes with swear words - doesn't add/change any content.

- [The Forgotten City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/)
  - A short (8-10 hour) first-person mystery game
  - Probably best to go in blind, trailers seem a bit spoilery
  - Recommended if on sale (or if you can play it on Xbox game pass for free)
  - Was originally a Skyrim mod, but eventuallyw as made into a standalone game
  - Fully voiced, very good graphics (if your computer allows it), presentation is overall very good
  - While I do like this game, it does feel a little shallow because the game is short, and there are so many characters to talk to/ground to cover during that time, but I do like it overall.

- [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/METAL_GEAR_RISING_REVENGEANCE/) (often 75% off!)
  - A short (7-10hrs?? without DLC), fun action game with memes
  - I didn't realize the game had/comes with the DLC - don't forget that after you finish the game!
  - Don't forget to get the weapon enhancements for your desired weapon (I beat the game...without realizing you could upgrade your weapon...)
  - I was confused as to how the free slice worked exactly:
    - You don't need to "swing the stick" to slice, you can just pull your right stick to the direction you want, then release the stick and let the stick go back to the center position (executing the slice). This is necessary for precise slicing.
    - Also remember that you can move the camera in slice mode with the left stick
  - Play this if you want a fun adrenaline game you can drop in/out of (thanks to heaps of quicksaves), but be prepared to get invested at the boss fights and near the end of the game.
  - This game was originally designed for a controller
  - You'll want to learn most of the game mechanics, as they will all eventually be used and/or make your life easier

### Uchikoshi Games

There are enough games by/involving Uchikoshi that I made a section for it

- [**AI: The Somnium Files**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/948740/AI_The_Somnium_Files/) - Recommended as a first Uchikoshi game, see below
  - One of my biggest concerns about Uchikoshi games has been accessibility - annoying puzzles or a long winded story can quickly put you off.
    - While the game has puzzles, most (with the exception of one) can be figured out by trial and error. The puzzles inherently tie in with the story, which makes them feel more meaningful.
    - The story is not *too* convoluted
  - People often have recommendations for the first major choice in the game. In the long run it doesn't matter, but if you want to know, see the below two dot points.
    - If you're the type of person who gets bored easily or think you might not finish the game, follow the left hand side path first.
    - If you're the type of person who's in it for the long run, you can try the right side first.
  - NOTE1: You can use the map in somniums! This is easy to forget, so I played the entire game without using it, making somniums more difficult.
  - NOTE2: I highly recommend using English voices.
  - Extra: As part of marketing for the game, there was a Youtube channel setup: [Lemniscate English](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxYoH_UNbIKP1xnsTx9m5Gw) , and twitter accounts @Lemniscate_Aset and @Ota_Matsushita. May be worth checking out after you finish the game - I don't think there are any major spoilers, but I wouldn't risk it.
  - I'll shill my own [fps camera mod](https://github.com/drojf/ai_somnium_fps_camera) mod for the game (use after finishing the game)

- [**Zero Escape Series (PC, NDS)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/Zero_Escape_The_Nonary_Games/) - Recommended
  - One of my favorite game series. Some of my gripes have been fixed in the recent steam release of the first two games.
  - Note that the third game in the series is very different to the first two games. Would reccomend you try the [first two games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/Zero_Escape_The_Nonary_Games/) first.

- **Ever17: the out of infinity (pc , psp, ps2,  dreamcast,  **xbox360 (remake)**...)** - Recommended, with guide

  - If you enjoy sci-fi and not so straightforward stories, you should play this game. if you get stuck while playing it, ask me and i'll be your mentor (lol)
  - Strongly suggest you use a walkthrough if you get stuck. GameFAQ has a fairly good 'no spoiler' walkthough. 
  - The game is no longer sold, so you will need to obtain it by other means...
  - Would not suggest to people who are new to general science fiction themes/ideas as it may be....confusing
  - This is just one game in the 'infinity' series: "_[Never 7: The End of Infinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Never_7:_The_End_of_Infinity&action=edit&redlink=1 "Never 7: The End of Infinity (page does not exist)")_,_[Remember 11: The Age of Infinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_11:_The_Age_of_Infinity "Remember 11: The Age of Infinity")_, _[12Riven ―the Ψcliminal of integral―](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12Riven_%E2%80%95the_%CE%A8climinal_of_integral%E2%80%95 "12Riven ―the Ψcliminal of integral―")_, and _[Code_18](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_18 "Code 18")" -from wikipedia_

## Freebird Games

- [**Finding Paradise**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/) - Recommended
  - Sequel to 'To the Moon'. Definitely worth a look if you played the first game.
  - "A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish"
  - I recommend this to pretty much everyone. Mainly a story driven experience.

- Imposter Factory
  - You really should play as many of the previous games before playing this game (including the minisodes)

## Need Writeup

I have played these games and would like to write something about them, but haven't got around to it yet.

- The Sexy Brutale
- Disco Elysium
- The return of the Obra Dinn

## Honorable Mentions

- Void Bastards
- CrossCode
- A Short Hike
- [Stars Die](https://yorkeegj.itch.io/stars-die)
  - I'm amazed how well this short game sets it's atmosphere through level/visual design and music
  - The slow, deliberate cutscenes/endings are amazing too
  - Somehow feels much "bigger" than it is/should be? Perhaps it evokes the imagination to fill in the gaps more than most media can.

- [**Juniper's Knot (Steam Page)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/687590/Junipers_Knot/) (Free)
  - A short, English visual novel. Can finish in one sitting (40mins? not sure how long). Should be played in the middle of the night with the lights off with decent headphones/speakers (it's NOT a horror game - this is just for setting the atmosphere). For PC AND iOS!
  - [Non-steam download page](http://junipersknot.dischan.org/)
