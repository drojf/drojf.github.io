### 'Free' games (mostly for PC):

Will add links later. For now, use google. Games are vaguely ordered in how much they are worth your time.  

-   [**Juniper's Knot (Steam Page)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/687590/Junipers_Knot/) - Highly Recommended
    -   A short, English visual novel. Can finish in one sitting (20-40mins? not sure how long). Should be played in the middle of the night with the lights off with decent headphones/speakers (it's NOT a horror game - this is just for setting the atmosphere). For PC AND iOS!
    - [Non-steam download page](http://junipersknot.dischan.org/)

-   [**Cave Story**](https://www.cavestory.org/) \- Highly Recommended
    -   Platformer with similar game mechanics to Metroid (or so I hear). I really enjoyed this game. After you have finished it, read a guide for extras/easter eggs
    - There is a version on Switch/Steam with upgraded graphics, but many prefer the original free version. The steam version is [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave_Story/) (not free!)

-   **Mother 3** - Highly Recommended

    -   Give it a go, even if you don't usually play RPGs (I usually don't, but I still enjoyed this game immensely). Technically, this game is not free.

-   [**Tyrian**](https://bitbucket.org/opentyrian/opentyrian/wiki/Home) 

    -   Old shoot'em up, now free due the original licences being nice. Google OpenTyrian for downloads - no need to run on dosbox since it was ported to x86

-   [**Osu!**](https://osu.ppy.sh/) 

    -   Rhythm game (basically Elite Beat Agents), very fun as no thinking is required. May injure your wrist if you play using a mouse. [my osu! page](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/drojf "My osu page. osu is a game like elite beat agents. or so i've heard.")
    -   If you experience visual lag on Intel integrated graphics, disable Speedstep (ie make your CPU run at max clock speed constantly)! 

-   [**Ib**](http://vgboy.dabomstew.com/other/ib.htm) \- Highly Recommended

    -   a horror/puzzle game. Better described at the english translation website. I suggest using a walkthrough after you have finished it once to see what you missed/didn't miss or if you get stuck. Now that I think about it, it was quite beautiful.

-   **[Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle](https://aeresland.net/)** Moderately Recommended
    -   "Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle is a "sprite opera" made by Saint Bomber in RPG Maker 2003."
    -   When you get stuck (believe me, you will), you can use this [Google Doc Walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3_9cWCMpCgdyiIiVNx4iIvOCfJMbKgfYOIz4zmSZVw/)

### Paid games:

-   **Phoenix Wright Series (GBA/NDS)**
    -   really liked the first game - Recommended

-   [**Zero Escape Series (PC, NDS)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/Zero_Escape_The_Nonary_Games/) - Recommended
    - One of my favorite game series. Some of my grips have been fixed in the recent steam release of the first two games.
    - Note that the third game in the series is very different to the first two games. Would reccomend you try the [first two games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/Zero_Escape_The_Nonary_Games/) first.

-   **Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective (NDS, iOS)**  - Recommended
    -   fun game with a nice story (by the same director as phoenix wright)

-   **Ever17: the out of infinity (pc , psp, ps2,  dreamcast,  **xbox360 (remake)**...)** - Recommended, with guide

    -   if you enjoy sci-fi and not so straightforward stories, you should play this game. if you get stuck while playing it, ask me and i'll be your mentor (lol)
    -   strongly suggest you use a walkthrough if you get stuck. GameFAQ has a fairly good 'no spoiler' walkthough. 
    -   the game is no longer sold, so you will need to obtain it by other means...
    -   would not suggest to people who are new to general science fiction themes/ideas as it may be....confusing
    -   This is just one game in the 'infinity' series: "_[Never 7: The End of Infinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Never_7:_The_End_of_Infinity&action=edit&redlink=1 "Never 7: The End of Infinity (page does not exist)")_,_[Remember 11: The Age of Infinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_11:_The_Age_of_Infinity "Remember 11: The Age of Infinity")_, _[12Riven ―the Ψcliminal of integral―](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12Riven_%E2%80%95the_%CE%A8climinal_of_integral%E2%80%95 "12Riven ―the Ψcliminal of integral―")_, and _[Code_18](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_18 "Code 18")" -from wikipedia_

-   [**Planescape: Torment (PC)**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/Planescape_Torment_Enhanced_Edition/) - Hightly Recommended. There is one point you can get stuck in this game...if you get stuck, look it up.
    - NOTE before buying: [Read the comments section of the GOG page](https://www.gog.com/game/planescape_torment_enhanced_edition). Probably still worth buying, especially when it is on sale.
    - One of my favorite pieces of media, however it's due to the overall presentation of the game story, world, etc, not because of the gameplay of the game.     
    -   ask someone about the game. there are many small things which do not spoil anything and do not detract from the game's experience but will help you play the game
    -   If you are the type to just finish a game quickly and not read any of the text...don't play this game
    -   Do all the quests you can find, talk to every major NPC. Save often. Sometimes you might not be able to go back.
    - Supposedly there is a 'upgraded' version on GOG, but I hear it has some bugs. Look into this before buying it.
    - There is a sequel called 'Torment: Tides of Numenera'. While still good, I don't think it is as good as the first game.

-   **Umineko Series (PC, PS3)** - [Steam Question Arcs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/) - [Steam PS3 patch page](https://github.com/07th-mod/guide/wiki/Umineko-Getting-started) - Recommended
    -   Very long, definitely only consider this if you are willing to commit to it
    -   Personally I feel like I enjoyed the first (1-4) more than the second(5-8), although both are still great
    -   There are mods which add voice acting, upgraded sprites and backgrounds ported from the PS3 game
        - The 07th mod patched version patches the MG release to add in as much as is feasible with the MG engine
        - The Umineko Project version is (kind of) a script interpreter for the PS3 game, so it's much closer to PS3 game. This mod is harder to obtain, and the Answer arcs aren't fully complete yet (as of 2018)
        - You might find some older 'umitweak' releases floating around - these patched the original game which only ran at 640x480 resolution.    

-   [**Antichamber**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/) - Recommended
    - First person mind bending puzzle game. Often on sale on steam.

-   [**Finding Paradise**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/) - Recommended
    - Sequel to 'To the Moon'. Definitely worth a look if you played the first game.
    - "A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish"
    - I recommend this to pretty much everyone. Mainly a story driven experience.
