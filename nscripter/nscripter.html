<h1>UncleMion's NScripter API Reference Mirror</h1>
<p>
    UncleMion's website has been down for some time now, and so I decided to mirror the NScripter API documentation.
    Fortunately the website was available on the WayBack Machine/Internet Archive. I downloaded the page and have mirrored it below:
</p>


<h3>Please go to the <a href="https://github.com/07th-mod/ponscripter-fork">07th-mod ponscripter landing page</a> and the <a href="https://07th-mod.github.io/ponscripter-fork/api/">07th-mod mirror of the NScripter reference</a> for the mirror and more info.</h3>

<h2>PONScripter/ONScripter/NScripter Tools</h2>
<p>
    If you are packaging .dat or .nsa files, you may need to use <strong>nscmake</strong> and <strong>nsamake</strong>.
    Recently we have found that the tools provided from Insani don't work properly on Windows 10/English locale.<br>
</p>
<p>
    The ONScripter Tools equivalent do the same thing (afaik), and do work properly, so I have mirrored the last release here:
    <a href="https://github.com/drojf/drojf.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.0/onscrtools-win32-20100915.zip">onscrtools-win32-20100915.zip</a>
</p>

<h3>Unnecessary .dat files</h3>
<p>
    Note that .dat files (generated by nscmake) are unnecessary in most cases, and only serve to obfuscate the game script.
    <ul>
        <li>NScripter will launch the file called "0.txt" if placed next to the .exe</li>
        <li>If you have multiple script files, you can use  "0.txt" through to "9.txt" (or "00.txt" through "99.txt"). 
            I think the engine treats them as if they were concatenated together.
        </li>
        <li>POnscripter uses the .utf file extension instead (I think it switches to legacy mode if you use a .txt extension - not sure.)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Unnecessary .nsa files</h3>
<p>
    Note that .nsa files (generated by nsamake) are unnecessary in most cases - you can just put the game files in the game directory and the game will read it.
    The main reason you'd want a .nsa file is if you have thousands of small files and want to package them as a single file.
